# project1_browser_game

## Introduction:
A shooting game similar to duck hunt from Nintendo.
Player will use the mouse with a target cursor to click on the moving object to score points.  (duck.. whatever)


## Technologies
Javascript, JQuery, CSS and HTML.

Tell us, on a high-level what technologies you are going to use to build the game
Tell us how you plan on implementing the difficult parts


## MVP
* The target cursor to interact with the moving object.
* scores points when each object is clicked
* calculate total scores


## Goals
create an effect similar to the dog picking up the dead duck after each shot.
lose 3 ducks then game over


## Stretch Goals
configure different scores base on how long it takes for the player to shoot the moving object


## Timeline
What do you need to have done by
* Monday - I should have a canvas with the background field that has ground, grass, trees and a moving target cursor.
* Tuesday - I should have at least 5 moving objects to shoot in 1 round and the object either explode or change image.
* Wednesday - for each moving object shot - keep scoring and determine wins.
* Thursday - set up round 2 if possible with faster moving object


## Wireframes
You can use whatever you want to make these (it can just be a drawing)
This must be checked into your repo and displayed in this section
If it's a drawing you can take a picture with your phone and upload it :)

## User Personas
A person with good hand-eye coordination or is trying to improve in this area.
A person who likes shooting games but does not wish to hurt anything in real life.


## User Stories
As a single player, I want to be able to move the target cursor to the moving target and click on it.
when the click hits on the target, I want to know that it hit (explodes and fall). I want to see the scores as i hit each target.
